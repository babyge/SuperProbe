This is a KiCad implementation of Carlson's Superprobe by Daniel L. Marks, KW4TI.

It integrates the probe into the PCB by using the ground plane and vias to shield the probe.  The solder mask is left off of the area around the probe so that the probe can be taped over with copper or aluminum tape for extra shielding.
